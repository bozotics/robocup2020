## PCB Design Files

Included in this repo are design files for the various PCBs we use. We designed these in EAGLE thanks to [Autodesk's free education licences](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured). 

If you are actually interested to look through these files (wow!) please do use the [this zip](https://github.com/bozotics/soccer2020/archive/40e15c43526de8042411a28897eb3d1dfd94261b.zip) (or [here](https://github.com/bozotics/soccer2020/tree/40e15c43526de8042411a28897eb3d1dfd94261b) if you want to browse the code on GitHub (y tho)) as the latest commit breaks everything while trying to export a nice looking 3d file.

The libraries used unfortunately cannot be shared due to Autodesk's library.io sharing limitations, however if you would like to view it do contact us! We would be happy to send a copy of the latest version, albeit without the included 3d models (again due to the library.io limitations).
