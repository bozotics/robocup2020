## PCB Design Files

Included in this repo are design files for the various PCBs we use. We designed these in EAGLE thanks to [Autodesk's free education licences](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured). 

The libraries used unfortunately cannot be shared due to Autodesk's library.io sharing limitations, however if you would like to view it do contact us! We would be happy to send a copy of the latest version, albeit without the included 3d models (again due to the library.io limitations).
